# Portfolio Site
This is a portfolio site to hold the works which I am most proud of. It can be very easily updated through basic GitHub control systems.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This was one of the first projects I made where I wanted to reference lots of other sources. It forced me to really nail down my CSS skills. The parallax scroll on the side of the site is a part I'm particularly proud of; it took a lot of fenaggling to make work for all different types of browsers and devices it could be shown on.
Additionally, the hardest part of this project was making it responsive in both desktop and mobile. The format that I drew together before putting together the design in code proved to be challenging to make work for all resolutions of screens. It was a very fun challenge!

## Lessons Learned:

It was beautiful seeing all my projects come together onto one site! I learned to make the site easily expandable in the event that I wanted to make more complex additions to the project in the future. Adding classes for clickable buttons and preformatted sections that I could pick and choose from will make this a lot easier to work on a year or two from now.
